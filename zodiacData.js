The Zodiac symbol for Aries is a Lamb, and Aries (along with Leo and Sagittarius) is regarded as a Fire Sign. Keeping in mind its role at the beginning of the Zodiac calendar, the Lamb (or Ram) symbolizes rebirth and new beginnings. But it also comes from an Ancient Greek Myth — the story of Phrixus and Helle (where Hellenic gets its name) — where the two heroes are eventually saved by a ram with golden wool.",
